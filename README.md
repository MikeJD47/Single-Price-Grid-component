## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using flexbox and grid together in harmony proved to be a bit of a head scratcher in this one, but luckily I figured it out. Little by little my skills are growing.
